# next-with-bulma

A small example of how someone could use [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) with [Bulma](https://bulma.io/).

In order to use Bulma, I was able to use [`@zeit/next-sass`](https://github.com/zeit/next-plugins/tree/master/packages/next-sass) to import Bulma's sass sheet directly from `node_modules`.

## Running
